# Data Structures

This repo includes data structures I created in some of my courses.

Heigh Balanced kd Tree: A kd tree except whenever an internal nodeâ€™s subtrees have heights that differ by more than a specified value, the subtree of the node is rebuilt into a perfectly balanced tree. Uses the Java built-in Point2D object.

Quake Heap: An alternative to the Fibonacci Heap, the quake heap implements a priority queue.  It is represented as a collection of binary trees, where the nodes of each tree are organized into levels.
